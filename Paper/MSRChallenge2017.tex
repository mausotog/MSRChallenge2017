% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Social interactions and attributes play a key role in software quality output 
from development teams~\cite{nagappan08,bettenburgh10}, these aspects have 
become more and more important and platforms that support software development 
processes provide every time a broader spectrum of measurements for social 
characteristics. Because of this we now have a wide variety of measurable social 
attributes that can be studied and analyzed to understand their correlation and 
impact on different success measures. 

This study aims to acknowledge the impact of some of these attributes when it 
comes to the quality of the commits developers write and its success when 
integrating into the project build through Travis CI. The knowledge obtained by 
analyzing how much impact social characteristics have on the success of a commit 
integration will help developers further understand what social attributes are 
better proxies for experience and coding excellence; and it will also help code 
integrators and core team members to know how to prioritize pull requests coming 
from different developers, which of them may have a higher probability of 
integration success based not only on the technical difficulty of the 
integration, but also on social factors that determine the expertise of the 
developer in their integration practices.

\textbf{Related work:}
Similar studies have shown the relationship between different attributes and 
different measures of success: pull request acceptance~\cite{gousios14, 
gousios15,tsay14icse,tsay14fse}, pull request evaluation latency~\cite{Yu15}.
Tsay et al~\cite{tsay14icse} performed a very relevant study where they 
determine that the social connection between the developer who is asking the 
pull request and the integrators is a key factor torwards acceptance of a pull 
request. Unlike this previous study, in our study we look at a broader aspect of 
social aspects and how this attributes towards the success in Travis CI jobs. 
Gousios et al~\cite{gousios14} study the relationship between the area of the 
source code being modified by the developer requesting the changes to be pulled 
and the acceptance rate of these changes is highly correlated. Also existence of 
tests and overall code quality~\cite{gousios15} are attributes that have a 
strong relationship with the acceptance rate of a pull request. Bettenburgh et 
al~\cite{bettenburgh10} discuss the impact of social interactions with 
post-release defects, Vasilescu et al~\cite{vasilescu14} explored how different 
project characteristics (programming language, project age, etc.) affect commit 
success when integrated to the automatic build process. Yu et al~\cite{yu16} 
analyze the impact of CI usage in Github and its correlation with software 
quality. Unlike the before mentioned, our study focuses on independent social 
attributes and how these relate to the success of the integration of a commit 
pushed by the developer being described by these social attributes. %, and not 
interactions between developers, or technical properties of the project.

\section{Research Design}
We present the approach taken to guide this study by
following the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology descibed by Basili et 
al~\cite{Basili84}.

\subsection{Goal}
The goal of this study is to have a deeper understanding of the relationship 
between the several different social properties that are gathered in a 
developer's online profile, and the likelihood of a commit performed by that 
developer to be considered a successfully integrated into its corresponding 
project according to Travis CI depending on the social attributes of the 
developer.


\subsection{Question}

Previous studies have identified a relationship between technical and social 
factors and pull request acceptance. In the interest of understanding if these 
relationship will hold with a different success measure such as commit 
integration success, and in order to establish a baseline to compare to, we 
deliver our first research question:
\newline \newline
\textbf{What is the relationship, if any, between technical attributes that 
describe the complexity of a commit (such as files added, tests added, lines of 
code, etc) and the final status of the Travis jobs this commit triggers?}
\newline \newline
Assuming the previous studies hold to this different success measure, and there 
is a relationship between technical attributes and commit integration success, 
we are afterwards interested in knowing if adding social attributes to this 
predictability model will increase the probability of the model asserting 
correctly future instances by knowing not only technical data about the commit 
being pushed but also social attributes of the developer pushing the changes:
\newline \newline
\textbf{Given the dataset described before, are the social attributes gathered 
from the Github profiles of developers who pushed those commits, able to 
increase the predictive power of a model created from the technical dataset?}
\newline \newline
We are also interested in knowing what attributes, either from the technical 
background, the social background, and both combined, are the best proxies for 
knowing what will be the success of the commit integration:
\newline \newline
\textbf{Which attributes (in social data, technical data, and both together) are 
the most decisive in order to know if a commit will be successful or not?}
\newline \newline
Finally, we would like to know if/which social attributes have a significant 
impact in success of commit integration to a project: \todo{I'm not sure what's 
the difference between this RQ and the last one}
\newline \newline
\textbf{Does any of the social attributes have a significant impact in the 
likelihood of commit integration success?}
\newline \newline

\subsection{Metric}
We created a linear regression model based on two different sets of data. Merely 
technical data related to technical aspects of the complexity of the commit, and 
a superset of this before-mentioned data and social data gathered from the 
developer who pushed the commit. We evaluate the predictive power of these two 
models with 10 fold cross validation and we analyze which of them is able to 
predict with higher accuracy the success of unseen commits.


\section{Building and Augmenting dataset with social attributes} 
\label{approach}
For this section our goal is to build a dataset based on the attributes that are 
intrinsic for the commit complexity and therefore for its probability of leading 
to a successful Travis CI job.
To do this we extracted the attributes from the original dataset 
provided~\cite{msr17challenge} which work as a proxy for the complexity of the 
commit being pushed.
\begin{itemize}
%\item tr\_original\_commit
%\item gh\_build\_started\_at 
\item git\_diff\_src\_churn 
\item gh\_diff\_files\_added 
\item gh\_diff\_files\_deleted 
\item gh\_diff\_files\_modified 
\item gh\_diff\_tests\_added 
\item gh\_diff\_tests\_deleted 
\item gh\_diff\_src\_files 
\item gh\_sloc 
%\item tr\_status 
\end{itemize}

Once we had these attributes, we removed repeated rows and we gathered the 
social attributes for each of these rows. 

To do this, we extracted from the original file provided~\cite{msr17challenge} 
the commit hash and the project name. We removed the repeated rows and created a 
script to gather the social data of the developer who pushed that commit.
First we concatenated the two attributes before mentioned in the following way:
\newline \newline
\textit{https://github.com/\textbf{NameOfProject}/commit/\textbf{CommitHash}}
\newline \newline
We created a script that constructs this string and navigates through the html 
representation of the website described above, and looks for the 
\textit{username} of the developer in the Github platform. If it is able to find 
one, we then create another string following the pattern:
\newline \newline
\textit{https://github.com/\textbf{UserName}}
\newline \newline
We then navigate through the html representation of the developer's profile 
website (described above) and gather the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Repositories
\item Stars
\item Followers
\item Following
\item ContribProjects
\end{itemize}

Repositories alludes to the repositories the developer has access to. This 
includes where the developer is the repository owner,where the developer is a 
collaborator, and repositories that the developer can access through an 
organization membership.\footnote{https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/} Stars 
show the projects the developer has stared, where starring translates to showing 
appreciation to the repository and creating a bookmark for later 
access.\footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/} Followers and 
Following detail the number of developers that are following and being followed 
by the developer in question. Finally, the last attribute studies is the number 
of contributions made by the developer in the last year. To this dataset, we 
also added from the original dataset provided~\cite{msr17challenge} the 
attribute gh\_by\_core\_team\_member which we considered to have also social 
weight, which describes if the developer pushing the commit is a core member of 
the project the commit is being pushed to.

After performing this last data mining task, we created two different datasets. 
One of them contains technical data that is seen as a proxy for the complexity 
of the changes being performed in the commit. We also created a second dataset 
which consists of the data mentioned in the first dataset, plus the set of 
social attributes related to the developer who pushed the commit. 

The dataset provided by the MSR Challenge~\cite{msr17challenge} is very diverse 
and consists of commits that date from very far back, and the social data we are 
gathering is recent data, gathered in January 2017. The researchers of this 
project acknowledge this discrepancy and in an effort to mitigate this threat to 
validity, we filter the commits analyzed by looking only at the commits pushed 
in the last 3 years of the dataset (2014,2015,2016), with the intuition that the 
social data gathered by this study will have a closer relationship to the social 
data if it were to be gathered in these years, than if we would compare it to 
years further back.

\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the predictive power we can gain from analyzing the corpus 
provided~\cite{msr17challenge}, we have created a logistic regression model from 
both the datasets described in Section \ref{approach}. A logistic regression 
model is one where the dependent variable is categorial~\cite{freedman09}. Since 
in this study we are interested only in the cases where the commit was 
successfully integrated against any other possible state (errored, failed, 
canceled, started), we have divided our corpus into only two possible states, 
successful and notSuccessful, as to have a binary dependent variable. 

A binary logistic model is a mechanism used to calculate the probability of 
characterizing a binary dependent variable based on one or more independent 
variables~\cite{walker67,cox58}. In our study, the binary dependent variable 
would become the final status of the Travis CI jobs triggered by the commit 
pushed by the developer, and the independent variables are both the technical 
attributes (files added, files deleted, source churn, etc) and the social 
attributes (stars, followers, repositories, etc.) used to predict the the class 
value.

We also evaluate our dataset by using decision trees, a predictive model which 
branches the different possible class values (represented as the leaves) 
depending on the attributes used to predict the class value (represented as the 
branches). In classification trees as the one being used in this study, each 
attribute represents a branch (with some exceptions due to pruning) and 
depending on the decisions taken while traversing the tree, the class value will 
be determined when one of the decisions leads to a leaf of the tree, therefore a 
class value will be encountered and a prediction can be made.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
